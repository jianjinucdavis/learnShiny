This repo represents my efforts learning shiny. 

My first shiny projects should contain the following steps:
	* generate and plot a random graph
	* generate and plot a scale-free graph
	* generate and plot a real-world graph
	* plot log-log degree distributions

By doing this, we could understand if the real-world graph is more similiar to a scale-free graph or a random graph.
